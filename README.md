# GetAuth for Mastodon

A very simple static site to generate Mastodon OAuth tokens. 

## How to use

You can either go to [getauth.thms.uk](https://getauth.thms.uk) and use it there, or you can simply clone the repository and just run it locally.

It's totally dependency free - no framework, no `npm` - just a couple of static html pages, and a css file.
